Big Picture — What TUDAO Nodes Actually Do

TUDAO’s nodes are not blockchain miners — they are application-layer service validators.
They sit between users, vendors, and the blockchain contracts that manage payments, scopes, and reputation.

They do three core things:

Function	Description	Where it happens
1. Transactional Validation	Verify that on-chain interactions (job creation, acceptance, milestone completion) align with DAO policy and data integrity.	On-chain + off-chain
2. Workflow Orchestration	Coordinate AI-generated scopes, vendor assignments, and customer updates. They act as decentralized “agents” running small, automatable tasks.	Off-chain
3. Governance & Emission Proof	Prove uptime, task verification, and participation to earn FEUs and maintain DAO trust score.	Off-chain → On-chain summary
🧩 How It Works in Practice

Here’s the logical flow:

A homeowner or property manager creates a project via the TUDAO platform (e.g., HVAC repair request).

The AI Scope Engine generates a work order and pushes it to the network.

Professional nodes pull the job from a queue → validate cost, scope, and vendor info.

Verifier nodes cross-check finished jobs, confirming “proof of completion.”

Founding / Architect nodes timestamp and sign the validated data → push summary to the smart contract.

Payments release automatically from escrow → node activity earns FEUs → emissions distribute to active participants.

🧱 Node Roles Breakdown

You can explain each role like this:

Node Role	Core Function	Typical Tasks
🧠 Architect Node	Master coordination node; governs network settings and emission policy.	- Monitor all subnodes
- Validate new contracts
- Manage FEU weighting
- Approve new license tiers
👑 Regent Nodes	Policy enforcement and system reliability; handle governance and configuration updates.	- Enforce node uptime standards
- Approve or deny node registrations
- Log high-level governance votes
🛡️ Guardian Nodes	Integrity & security layer; monitor data consistency and fraud detection.	- Scan for duplicated or fake job entries
- Hash comparison / integrity proofs
- Alert system anomalies
🗳️ Councilor Nodes	Governance and communication layer; handle proposals, DAO voting, and human validation.	- Collate votes and proposals
- Distribute DAO announcements
- Aggregate Snapshot or off-chain governance results
🔮 Oracle Nodes	Bridge between external systems and TUDAO; provide data feeds, cost indexes, and vendor ratings.	- Pull market data (e.g., material cost)
- Update AI models
- Feed verified info back to network
🪶 Simplified MVP (Phase 2–3 Focus)

For your current MVP, these roles collapse into 3 functional buckets:

Governance & uptime (Founding nodes: Architect + Regent + Guardian + Councilor)

Task handling (Professional nodes – in later phase)

Verification (Verifier nodes – in later phase)

That means:

Right now, your family nodes will perform governance, uptime tracking, and registry validation.
Later, as the AI/job marketplace layer launches, they’ll start coordinating actual work orders and payment flows.

🧮 What Each Node Does Today (MVP)

Until smart contracts and jobs are integrated:

Function	What happens now	How to show it visually
Heartbeat / Proof-of-Uptime	Each node sends a ping every 60 seconds.	Dashboard shows ✅ “online” with last heartbeat time.
Registration Proof	Each node is registered under a verified wallet address.	Node table shows wallet + title (Architect, Regent, etc.).
Governance Readiness	Wallets hold Founding NFTs (FEUs) and appear in Snapshot.	Governance page shows eligible voters.
Emission Simulation	Each node earns simulated FEUs for uptime.	FEU counter increases every hour/day online.

This is your MVP demonstration:
a visible, living network of independent wallets + active nodes + on-chain licenses.

🧠 Later Expansion — Real Work

When the TUDAO platform’s job marketplace goes live, nodes will:

Host the AI Scope Engine microservice (each node can generate scopes via API).

Handle off-chain escrow state (bridging customer requests and smart contracts).

Run verification oracles to confirm work completion.

Participate in reputation scoring and tokenized governance.

🧩 TL;DR — “What do TUDAO Nodes actually do?”

TUDAO nodes are decentralized service agents that keep the system fair, transparent, and functional.
They record uptime, verify workflows, and coordinate AI-powered contracting processes — ensuring every job is scoped, validated, and paid through the DAO.

In short:

They’re the “backbone servers” of TUDAO — part governance, part validation, part proof-of-trust.
