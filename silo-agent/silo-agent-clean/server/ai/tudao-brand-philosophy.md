# TUDAO Brand Philosophy: Fair Market Service Delivery

## Core Mission

TUDAO (TradeUnion DAO) revolutionizes service marketplaces by **eliminating the 20% management company markup** while maintaining professional quality standards. We connect customers directly with skilled workers, creating a win-win where:

- **Customers pay fair market rates** (not inflated by corporate overhead)
- **Vendors earn fair market pay** (not reduced by management fees)
- **Quality remains professional** (TUDAO standards ensure excellence)

## The 20% Problem

Traditional property management companies and service platforms charge significant markups:
- Customers pay 100% + 20% markup = **120% of market rate**
- Vendors receive 100% - 20% commission = **80% of their work value**
- **40% spread** that benefits only the middleman, not the service provider or customer

TUDAO's direct connection model eliminates this inefficiency.

## TUDAO Quality Standards

### Residential vs. Commercial Differentiation

TUDAO recognizes that professional quality looks different across property types, while maintaining high standards for both:

**Residential Standards:**
- Professional quality appropriate for homeowners
- Reasonable scope and scale for residential properties
- Example: 2-3" mulch depth (standard residential coverage)
- Fair pricing without management markup
- Reliable, timely service

**Commercial Standards:**
- Professional quality meeting business requirements
- Compliance with commercial best practices
- Example: 4" mulch depth (Walmart/commercial standard)
- Licensed services where required
- Higher frequency and precision requirements

### Quality Tiers

TUDAO uses three quality tiers in the platform:

1. **tudao_standard**: TUDAO's professional quality benchmark for fair market service
2. **industry_baseline**: Established industry standards (e.g., Walmart commercial practices)
3. **premium**: Above-standard service for customers wanting enhanced quality

The default is **tudao_standard** - representing quality work at fair prices.

## Service Philosophy

### Residential Services

**Example: Residential Landscaping**
- Weekly or bi-weekly lawn maintenance during growing season
- Professional 2-3" mulch depth (162 sq ft coverage per cubic yard at 2")
- All-inclusive mulch pricing: $65/cu yd (material + labor + delivery) + $50 mobilization minimum
- Fertilization 3-4 times per year recommended
- Common irrigation repairs included; major repairs quoted separately
- Tree pruning for ornamental/shade trees under 20ft

**Pricing Approach:**
- Labor hours based on actual production rates (not inflated)
- Materials at true cost (not marked up 20%)
- Transparent line-item calculations
- Fair hourly rates for skilled work

### Commercial Services

**Example: Commercial Landscaping**
- More frequent service (weekly year-round, multiple times per month)
- Higher standards: 4" mulch depth, licensed chemical applications
- Strict compliance requirements (no chemicals near stormwater, safety protocols)
- Professional appearance "first-class condition" standards
- Service level agreements and guarantees

**Pricing Approach:**
- Same transparency as residential
- Accounts for higher labor requirements
- Compliance and licensing costs included
- Fair compensation for commercial-grade reliability

## Implementation in AI System

The TUDAO AI Scope Engine automatically applies appropriate standards based on property type:

1. **Property Type Detection**: Early question asks "Residential or Commercial?"
2. **Standard Selection**: AI filters production standards and training examples by property type
3. **Question Flow**: Appropriate questions shown (residential frequencies vs. commercial SLAs)
4. **Scope Generation**: GPT-5 synthesizes scopes using property-appropriate benchmarks
5. **Transparent Pricing**: Line-item calculations show fair market rates without markup

### RAG Learning by Property Type

The system learns separately for residential and commercial:
- Residential training examples teach appropriate residential scope/pricing
- Commercial training examples teach business-grade standards
- Both emphasize TUDAO values: transparency, fairness, quality
