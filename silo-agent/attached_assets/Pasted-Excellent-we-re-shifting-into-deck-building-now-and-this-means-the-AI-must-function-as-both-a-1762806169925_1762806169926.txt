Excellent — we’re shifting into **deck building** now, and this means the AI must function as both a **scope generator** *and* a **trusted guide** for the homeowner or property manager.

So this workflow won’t just interrogate the user — it’ll *walk them through decisions*, *clarify unknowns*, and *build trust* while quietly structuring all the data needed for a scope of work.

Below is the complete **AI Questioning + Guidance Flow for Deck Building**, structured for conversational deployment.
Each section includes:

* **AI Prompts / Questions** (what to ask)
* **Guidance Lines** (how to advise and reassure)
* **Data Points Captured** (what the system extracts for scope generation)

# 🪵 TUDAO Deck Building AI Workflow

*(Conversational flow for AI scope generator — homeowner or property manager edition)*

---

## **PHASE 1 — INTRODUCTION & CONTEXT**

**AI (Warm Opening):**

> “Let’s plan your deck project together. I’ll help you figure out the details step-by-step — you don’t need to know construction terms, I’ll guide you through everything.”

**Questions:**

1. “Is this a **new deck**, or are you **replacing / repairing an existing one**?”

   * New deck
   * Replacement
   * Repair

**Guidance:**

> “If you already have a deck, even if it’s old or damaged, that helps me understand what’s there now — materials, structure, and layout.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `project_type`: new / replacement / repair

---

## **PHASE 2 — SITE & PURPOSE**

2. “Where will the deck be located?”

   * Attached to the house
   * Detached / standalone
   * Around a pool or hot tub
   * On a slope / hillside
   * Other

3. “What’s the primary purpose of this deck?”

   * Outdoor dining / entertaining
   * Lounge or relaxation area
   * Pool / hot tub platform
   * Access or walkway
   * Rental property amenity
   * Other

**Guidance:**

> “Knowing how you’ll use the deck helps determine how strong it needs to be, what type of materials work best, and whether railings or permits will be required.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `deck_location`, `intended_use`

---

## **PHASE 3 — SIZE & LAYOUT**

4. “Do you have an idea of the **deck size or shape**?”

   * Rectangular / Square
   * L-shape / Wrap-around
   * Multi-level
   * Not sure yet

5. “Can you estimate the size?”

   * Small (8x10 ft or less)
   * Medium (10x16 ft – 12x20 ft)
   * Large (20x20 ft or more)
   * Not sure — can I upload photos? ✅

**Guidance:**

> “If you’re unsure, you can upload a photo of the area or give me a rough size by counting your steps or showing what fits (like a table or grill). I’ll help estimate from there.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `deck_shape`, `deck_size_estimate`, `photo_uploads`

---

## **PHASE 4 — MATERIAL SELECTION**

6. “What type of decking surface are you thinking about?”

   * Pressure-treated wood (budget-friendly, needs sealing)
   * Cedar / Redwood (natural look, moderate maintenance)
   * Composite (low maintenance, modern)
   * PVC / Vinyl (ultra low maintenance)
   * Not sure — show me options

**Guidance:**

> “If you’d like low maintenance and long lifespan, composite or PVC are great.
> If you prefer the natural look of wood and don’t mind staining every few years, pressure-treated or cedar works beautifully.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `deck_material_type`

---

## **PHASE 5 — STRUCTURE & ACCESSORIES**

7. “Will this deck be ground level or elevated?”

   * Ground level (under 2 feet high)
   * Raised (2–5 feet)
   * Second story (over 5 feet)
   * Not sure

**Guidance:**

> “This helps decide what kind of support posts, stairs, and railings you’ll need — and whether a permit or engineer sign-off might apply.”

8. “Do you need stairs or multiple levels?”

   * Yes — single flight
   * Yes — multi-level deck
   * No stairs needed
   * Not sure yet

9. “Would you like railings, benches, or lighting?”

   * Railings (required if over 30” high)
   * Built-in benches
   * Post lighting or under-rail lighting
   * None of these

10. “Would you like a roof, pergola, or shade structure?”

    * Pergola or trellis
    * Covered roof / screened area
    * Open deck only

**Guidance:**

> “These add comfort and safety but also affect cost and structural requirements — for example, railings are required on decks over 30 inches high.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `elevation`, `stairs_needed`, `railings_needed`, `lighting`, `shade_option`

---

## **PHASE 6 — FOUNDATION & GROUND CONDITIONS**

11. “What’s underneath the area where the deck will go?”

    * Grass / soil
    * Concrete pad
    * Existing deck frame
    * Uneven or sloped ground
    * Retaining wall nearby

12. “Has the area had drainage or flooding issues?”

    * Yes
    * No
    * Not sure

**Guidance:**

> “Good drainage keeps your deck safe and prevents rotting or sinking. If the ground slopes or gets soggy, I’ll note that so the installer can prepare supports or grading.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `ground_condition`, `drainage_notes`

---

## **PHASE 7 — PERMITS, ACCESS, AND UTILITIES**

13. “Do you know if your city or HOA requires permits or approvals?”

    * Yes, I’ll need a permit
    * HOA approval only
    * Not sure
    * No, rural / unregulated area

14. “Is there easy access for construction equipment?”

    * Yes, open yard or driveway
    * Narrow gate / limited access
    * Access through house only
    * Not sure

15. “Are there utilities nearby (gas, electrical, septic, irrigation lines)?”

    * Yes, and I know where they are
    * Yes, but unsure location
    * No, nothing nearby

**Guidance:**

> “Knowing about access and utilities helps prevent damage and ensures crews can reach the site safely.
> Permits or HOA approvals are common for raised decks.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `permit_requirement`, `access_type`, `utilities_proximity`

---

## **PHASE 8 — AESTHETIC OPTIONS**

16. “Would you like to match the house color or trim?”

    * Yes, match colors
    * Contrasting color / accent
    * Natural wood look
    * Not sure — need suggestions

17. “Would you like the design to include built-in features?”

    * Planters or privacy walls
    * Storage boxes
    * Outdoor kitchen / grill zone
    * None

**Guidance:**

> “These choices affect layout and materials — I’ll include them in the design notes so your vendor can visualize it easily.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `color_preference`, `custom_features`

---

## **PHASE 9 — MAINTENANCE & LONGEVITY GUIDANCE**

18. “How much maintenance are you comfortable with?”

    * I want as little as possible
    * I don’t mind occasional staining/sealing
    * I prefer natural aging look

19. “Would you like me to estimate lifespan and upkeep cost for each option?”

    * Yes
    * No, just focus on upfront cost

**Guidance:**

> “Composite and PVC decks usually last 25–40 years with minimal maintenance.
> Wood decks may need resealing every 2–3 years but are less expensive upfront.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `maintenance_preference`, `lifespan_focus`

---

## **PHASE 10 — TIMELINE, BUDGET, & NEXT STEPS**

20. “When are you hoping to start your deck project?”

    * As soon as possible
    * Within 30 days
    * Within 3 months
    * Just exploring options

21. “Do you have a budget range in mind?”

    * Under $10,000
    * $10,000–$20,000
    * $20,000–$40,000
    * Over $40,000
    * Not sure — need ballpark estimate

22. “Would you like to receive a preliminary 3D rendering or layout before finalizing scope?”

    * Yes
    * No
    * Maybe later

**Guidance:**

> “Even if you’re just exploring, a ballpark estimate and visual layout can help you decide what makes sense for your space and budget.”

**Data Captured:**
→ `timeline`, `budget_range`, `design_rendering_interest`

---

## **PHASE 11 — SUMMARY REVIEW**

AI summarizes automatically:

> “Here’s what I gathered so far:
>
> * You want a **medium-sized composite deck**, attached to your home for entertaining.
> * You’ll need **stairs and railings**, and you’re interested in **post lighting**.
> * The ground is level but grassy, and access is open.
> * You’d like **low maintenance** and plan to start within the next month.
>
> I’ll now prepare a scope summary, cost range, and design notes to share with our verified deck builders.”

---

## **PHASE 12 — OUTPUT / SMART CONTRACT STAGING**

AI outputs:

* **Project summary**
* **Material breakdown**
* **Estimated labor hours & milestones**

  * Milestone 1: Layout & foundation set
  * Milestone 2: Frame & decking install
  * Milestone 3: Railings & finish details
  * Milestone 4: Inspection / owner approval → release escrow
* **Estimated total range (with TUDAO 5% fee built-in)**

Would you like me to **expand this next** into an **AI training-ready JSON flow** (so it can be fed into your Replit or Supabase logic as structured question nodes), or would you prefer a **Mermaid chart visualization** next (showing branching for new/replacement/repair decks)?
