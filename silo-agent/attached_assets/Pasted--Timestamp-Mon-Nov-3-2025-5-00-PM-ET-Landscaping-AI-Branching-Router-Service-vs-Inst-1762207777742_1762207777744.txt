# Landscaping AI — Branching Router (Service vs. Installation)

Below is a **service-agnostic, elderly-friendly** questioning flow that first classifies intent, then branches into **Service/Maintenance/Repair** vs **Installation/Replacement/New Build**. It’s designed for text, voice, or photo input and gracefully handles “I don’t know” answers.

---

## Master Router (Intent → Service vs Installation)

**AI (warm, simple):**

> “Tell me what you’d like done, or upload a couple photos. I’ll do the heavy lifting.”

**Detect intent (keywords + signals + photos):**

* **Service cues:** mow, trim, clean up, fix, repair, patch, diagnose, tune-up, one-time, weekly, storm debris.
* **Installation cues:** install, replace, new bed, new sod, new design, re-do, add rock/mulch, landscape overhaul.

**Clarify if ambiguous (one line, big buttons):**

* “Are you looking to **fix/maintain** what you have, or **add/install** something new?”

  * ✅ Service / Maintenance / Repair
  * ✅ Installation / Replacement / New

# SERVICE Flow (Maintenance / Repair)

**Design principles:** symptom-first, estimate by ranges, minimal measurements, photo-assisted, “I’m not sure” OK.

### Step S1 — What needs attention?

> “What should we take care of?”
> Buttons (icons): **Mowing/Trimming**, **Cleanup (leaves/branches)**, **Mulch refresh**, **Shrub/Tree trim**, **Repair (sprinklers, edging, damage)**, **Other / Not sure**

### Step S2 — Scope without measurements

* “About how big is the area?” → **Small (a few spots)** / **Medium (front yard)** / **Large (front & back)** / **Not sure**
* “Can you add a couple photos?” → **Upload** / **Skip for now**

*(If photos: AI infers size, debris, access, slope, obstacles.)*

### Step S3 — Access & frequency

* “Is it easy to reach the area?” → **Easy** / **Gate** / **Hilly/steps** / **Not sure**
* “Is this **one-time** or **ongoing**?” → **One-time** / **Weekly** / **Every 2 weeks**

### Step S4 — Timing & budget comfort

* “When would you like this done?” → **ASAP** / **This week** / **Browsing prices**
* “Would you like a **quick ballpark** now and a **final quote after a photo/visit**?” → **Yes** / **No**

### Step S5 — Friendly summary & edit

AI reads back in plain English with photos inline.

> “You want a leaf cleanup in the front yard, easy access, this week. We’ll provide the bags and haul-away.”

### Step S6 — Estimate & contract-lite

* Show **simple range** (includes TUDAO fee silently).
* Offer **visit if needed** (for uncertain items).
* Present **clear milestone(s)**:

  * Milestone 1: Service completed → **Release escrow** after approval.

  S6 --> S7[Vendor Match -> Finalize -> Schedule]
```

# INSTALLATION Flow (New/Replace/Overhaul)

**Design principles:** visualize choices, defaults by region, avoid measurements (use photos + categories), permit/haul-away prompts only when relevant.

### Step I1 — What are we installing?

Buttons with pictures: **New sod**, **Mulch/Rock beds**, **Planting (flowers/shrubs/trees)**, **Redesign/Overhaul**, **Edging/Border**, **Irrigation (new/extend)**, **Other**

### Step I2 — Style & material (show examples)

* “Which look do you like?” → **Natural mulch**, **Decorative rock**, **Simple green lawn**, **Low-maintenance beds**, **Not sure—show me options**
* If mulch/rock: “Should we **bring material** and **match your photos**, or show choices?”
* If sod: AI suggests local types (e.g., fescue/bermuda/zoysia) with tooltips.

### Step I3 — Area & prep (no tape measure needed)

* “About how big?” → **Small** / **Medium** / **Large** / **Not sure** (photos help)
* “Do we need to **remove what’s there** first?” → **Yes** / **No** / **Not sure**
* “Should we **haul away** old material?” → **Yes** / **No** / **Not sure**
* “Any **sprinklers** in the area?” → **Yes** / **No** / **Not sure**

### Step I4 — Extras & constraints

* “Any **borders/edging**?”
* “Is access **easy** or **gated/hilly**?”
* “Any **HOA or city rules** we should know?” → **Not sure** is fine (AI flags for vendor check).
* (If tree installs > certain size) suggest **utility locate** check.

### Step I5 — Timing & budget comfort

* “When do you want it done?” → **ASAP** / **This month** / **Browsing**
* “Want a **visual proposal** with materials listed and a **clear total** before you decide?” → **Yes**

### Step I6 — Plain-English proposal & milestones

AI generates a **clean mini-proposal**:

* **Scope:** prep, install, materials, haul-away.
* **Visuals:** example photos or AI matches from uploads.
* **Estimate:** single total or range (materials + labor; TUDAO fee included).
* **Milestones** (example):

  1. Deposit escrow (materials ordered)
  2. Installation day complete
  3. Final walk-through & approval → release remaining escrow

## AI Prompt Logic (Drop-in Pseudocode)

Use this **router + branch template** in Replit (or any agent framework). It’s tolerant of “I don’t know,” prioritizes **photos**, and always produces a **summary + estimate + milestones**.

```pseudo
FUNCTION handle_landscaping_intake(user_input, photos):
  intent = classify_intent(user_input, photos)  // "service" | "installation" | "unclear"
  IF intent == "unclear":
    ASK("Are we fixing/maintaining what you have, or adding/installing something new?",
        OPTIONS=["Service/Maintenance/Repair","Installation/Replacement/New"])
    intent = USER_CHOICE

  IF intent == "service":
    return run_service_flow(user_input, photos)
  ELSE:
    return run_installation_flow(user_input, photos)

FUNCTION run_service_flow(input, photos):
  tasks = ask_multi("What should we take care of?", 
    ["Mowing/Trimming","Cleanup","Mulch refresh","Shrub/Tree trim","Repair","Other/Not sure"])
  size = ask_size_or_photo(photos) // small/medium/large/unknown; invite photos
  access = ask_simple("Access?", ["Easy","Gate","Hilly/steps","Not sure"])
  freq = ask_simple("One-time or ongoing?", ["One-time","Weekly","Every 2 weeks"])
  timing = ask_simple("When?", ["ASAP","This week","Browsing prices"])
  summary = build_plain_summary(tasks, size, access, freq, timing, photos)
  confirmed = confirm(summary)
  estimate = estimate_service(tasks, size, access, photos)  // returns range with TUDAO fee included
  milestones = ["Service complete -> release escrow"]
  return package_result(summary, estimate, milestones)

FUNCTION run_installation_flow(input, photos):
  type = ask_single("What are we installing?",
    ["New sod","Mulch/Rock beds","Planting","Redesign/Overhaul","Edging/Border","Irrigation","Other"])
  style = offer_examples(type)  // allow "Not sure—show options"
  size = ask_size_or_photo(photos)
  prep = ask_yes_no_unknown("Remove existing first?")
  haul = ask_yes_no_unknown("Haul away old material?")
  irrigation = ask_yes_no_unknown("Sprinklers in area?")
  extras = ask_multi("Any extras?", ["Edging","Border","None"])
  rules = ask_yes_no_unknown("Any HOA/city rules?")
  access = ask_simple("Access?", ["Easy","Gate","Hilly/steps","Not sure"])
  timing = ask_simple("When?", ["ASAP","This month","Browsing"])
  summary = build_plain_summary([type,style,extras], size, access, timing, photos, prep, haul, irrigation, rules)
  confirmed = confirm(summary)
  estimate = estimate_installation(type, size, style, prep, haul, access, photos) // range or total
  milestones = ["Deposit (materials) -> escrow", "Installation complete", "Final walk-through -> release escrow"]
  return package_result(summary, estimate, milestones)
```

## Data Outputs (for downstream contract & matching)

* **JobType:** Service | Installation
* **SubTasks/Type:** e.g., “Cleanup + Mulch refresh” | “New sod + Edging”
* **SizeCategory:** Small | Medium | Large | Unknown (with photo_inference=true/false)
* **Access:** Easy | Gate | Hilly/steps | Unknown
* **Materials:** Bring | Customer-provided | Decide later
* **Prep/HaulAway:** Yes | No | Unknown
* **IrrigationNearby:** Yes | No | Unknown
* **Timing:** ASAP | Week | Month | Browsing
* **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low (based on photos vs. text only)
* **Milestones:** Array (tailored to branch)
* **Photos:** URLs (annotated)
* **Permit/HOA Flag:** true/false (installation types or user signal)

---

## UX Safeguards for “I don’t know”

* Every question offers **Not sure** and a **Photo upload** alternative.
* When “Not sure,” AI sets a **vendor-verify flag** and keeps the user moving forward.
* Estimates are **ranges** until verification; language stays reassuring:

  * “We’ll confirm details on a quick visit or from your photos—no surprises.”
