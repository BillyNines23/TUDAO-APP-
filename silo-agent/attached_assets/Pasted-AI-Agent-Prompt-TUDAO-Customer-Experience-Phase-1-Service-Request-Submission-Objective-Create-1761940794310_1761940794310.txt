AI Agent Prompt: TUDAO Customer Experience — Phase 1 (Service Request Submission)

Objective:
Create a no-code interactive prototype for the TUDAO Customer App that walks a user through requesting a service. The app should simulate the complete customer flow from “Get Started” to “Submit Request.”

🔹 Prompt for the AI Agent

You are building the TUDAO Customer Experience Flow (Phase 1) — a simple, conversational or screen-based prototype.
Your goal is to replicate the user journey below with clear screens, buttons, and text prompts.
No coding is required — only visual UI logic, text, and mock interaction flow.

🧩 Step-by-Step Build Instructions
1. App Setup

Title: TradeUnion DAO (TUDAO)

Subtitle: “Connecting with Verified, Skilled Workers — Powered by Smart Contracts”

Primary Color Scheme: Blue + Steel Gray

Add one main CTA button: [ Get Started ]

2. Step One — Choose Action

Prompt / Screen Text:

“What would you like to do today?”

Buttons:

✅ Request a Service

🧰 Become a Provider

Action: Selecting “Request a Service” continues to next screen.

3. Step Two — Input Type Prompt

Prompt / Screen Text:

“What do you need help with today?”

Provide text input box and microphone icon.

Example placeholder: “I need fence repairs.”

When user submits, continue to AI Scope Engine.

4. Step Three — AI Scope Engine

Agent behavior:

Read the user input.

Categorize it into a service type (e.g., Fence Repair).

Start the Smart Scope Wizard using logical follow-up questions.

5. Step Four — Smart Scope Wizard (Progressive Prompts)

Ask these in sequence:

“What type of fence?” → Options: Wood / Vinyl / Chain Link

“Approximate length?” → Options: 10–25ft / 25–50ft / 50+

“What’s wrong with it?” → Options: Leaning / Broken boards / Rotting posts

“Would you like to upload photos?” → Button: [ Upload Photos 📷 ] (optional)

“When would you like the work done?” → Options: ASAP / This week / Flexible

Then show button:
✅ [ Generate Scope ]

6. Step Five — Scope Preview

Prompt / Screen Text:

“Here’s your AI-generated job scope based on your details.”

Example output:

“Replace 5 fence panels and reinforce 3 posts on a 50ft wood fence. Includes debris haul-away.”

Buttons:

✅ Accept Scope

✏️ Edit Scope

🔄 Start Over

When “Accept Scope” is tapped, move to vendor matching.

7. Step Six — Vendor Matching

Prompt / Screen Text:

“We’ve found verified providers near you.”

Display mock cards for 2–5 vendors:

Name

Rating (⭐4.9, etc.)

Past jobs (short description)

Price range ($$$)

TUDAO badge image

Button under each: [ View Proposal ]

8. Step Seven — Proposal Details

Prompt / Screen Text:

“Here’s a proposal from your selected vendor.”

Display:

Scope summary

Cost estimate (e.g., $480)

Time window (e.g., Thursday 9AM)

Payment options: Crypto / Card

Escrow disclaimer:

“Funds are securely held in smart contract and released upon completion.”

Buttons:

✅ Submit Request

🔙 Back to Vendors

Final confirmation message:

“Your request has been submitted! You’ll receive updates as vendors confirm scheduling.”

🎨 Additional Instructions

Keep interface clean, minimalist, and intuitive.

Each step should load as a new “screen” or “card.”

Add mock icons for:

📷 Photos

💬 Chat bubbles

🪙 TUDAO badge

Include a progress bar or step tracker at the top (Step 1 of 8, Step 2 of 8, etc.)

Include TUDAO logo watermark or text on each screen.

⚙️ Optional Enhancements

Let AI agent store session data so the scope can be “edited” later.

Add confirmation pop-ups for each major step.

Prepare space in UI for future:

Milestone tracking

Escrow balance display

“While you’re here…” add-on job flow
