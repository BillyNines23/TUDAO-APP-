In roofing, production is typically measured in "squares" per man-hour or per day, where one "square" equals 100 square feet of roof surface area. 
Production Rate Rules of Thumb (Asphalt Shingles)
For an average asphalt shingle installation on a standard, walkable-pitch roof (e.g., a 4/12 to 6/12 pitch), the general benchmarks are:
Per Man-Hour (Installation Only): A skilled roofer can typically install between 1.5 to 2.5 squares per hour.
Per Day (Installation Only): This translates to approximately 12 to 20 squares per roofer in an 8-hour day under optimal conditions.
Full Job (Tear-off and Install): A competent 4- to 6-person crew can often tear off an old roof and install a new asphalt shingle roof on an average house (15 to 25 squares) in a single day. 
Factors Affecting Production
The actual production rate can vary significantly due to several project nuances:
Roof Pitch (Steepness): Steeper roofs (7/12 pitch and above) require more safety precautions (harnesses, scaffolding) and are physically harder to work on, which slows down production considerably.
Roof Complexity: A simple gable roof with long, straight runs is the fastest. "Hip city" roofs with many valleys, hips, chimneys, skylights, and vents require significantly more cutting and fitting time, reducing overall squares-per-hour production.
Number of Layers: Tearing off multiple layers of old shingles (a common scenario in reroofing) adds substantial time and labor for removal and disposal.
Material Type:
Asphalt shingles are the fastest and most common.
Metal, tile, or slate require specialized skills and are far more labor-intensive to install, resulting in lower squares per day rates.
Accessibility: How easily materials can be delivered to the roof (e.g., ground drop vs. crane/forklift) affects efficiency.
Weather: Extreme heat or bad weather can halt work or reduce productivity. 
Financial Rules of Thumb
Labor Costs: For asphalt shingle jobs, labor typically accounts for around $200 to $350 per square (of the total project cost).
