Mulch is categorized into two main types: organic (derived from natural materials that decompose) and inorganic (non-living materials like stone or rubber). The most common colors available are variations of brown, black, and red, as well as natural shades. 
1. Organic Mulches
Organic mulches decompose over time, adding beneficial nutrients and organic matter to the soil. 
Type 	Description	Common Colors	Notes
Shredded Bark/Wood Chips	The most common type, made from various hardwoods or softwoods. Shredded bark is good for slopes as it knits together.	Natural Brown, Black, Red, Gold, or Natural (undyed)	Color-enhanced mulches use dyes that can last a full season or more before fading.
Pine Needles (Pine Straw)	Long, thin needles that are lightweight and excellent for acid-loving plants like azaleas and blueberries.	Natural Brown, Reddish-Brown	Decomposes slowly and does not mat down like leaves can.
Compost/Shredded Leaves	Nutrient-rich and excellent for improving soil health. Best when shredded to avoid matting.	Dark Brown to Black	Often used as a soil amendment rather than a top dressing due to fine texture.
Straw/Hay	Stalks from grain crops (straw is preferred as hay may contain seeds). Commonly used in vegetable gardens or for erosion control after seeding.	Natural Golden Brown/Tan	Lightweight and inexpensive.
Cedar/Cypress Mulch	Aromatic wood that naturally repels some insects. Known for its longevity and pleasant scent.	Light to Medium Brown	Can be more expensive than other wood mulches.
2. Inorganic Mulches
Inorganic mulches do not decompose, offering a more permanent solution but without adding nutrients to the soil. 
Type 	Description	Common Colors	Notes
Gravel/Stone/Pebbles	Various crushed stones, river rocks, or lava rock. Best for rock gardens, pathways, or areas with cacti.	Gray, White, Red (lava rock), Brown, Tan	Long-lasting but absorbs heat and can be difficult to clean once weeds establish.
Recycled Rubber	Made from shredded tires. Extremely durable and maintains color well.	Black, Brown, Red	Does not decompose or improve soil; can be more expensive upfront.
Landscape Fabric/Plastic Sheeting	Acts as a physical barrier against weeds.	Black, Brown	Installed under other mulches or on its own for specific uses (like warming soil for heat-loving vegetables).
Choosing a Color
The most common colors in the landscaping service industry are natural brown, black, and red: 
Brown: Provides a subtle, natural look that blends well with nearly any home and plant color.
Black: Offers a modern, dramatic contrast that makes green foliage and bright flowers "pop".
Red: Creates a vibrant, energetic look that pairs well with warm-toned homes (like brick or tan) and yellow/white flowers. 
The choice of color can influence soil temperature (dark colors absorb more heat) and the overall aesthetic of a landscape.
