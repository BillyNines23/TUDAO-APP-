🧭 Conversational Flow: Generating a Vendor-Ready SOWThe flow is broken into four distinct phases, each designed to capture specific, necessary data points while maintaining a supportive, consultative tone.Phase 1: Project Initiation & High-Level IntentThe goal is to capture the "What" and "Why" of the project and set the overall tone and category (e.g., Landscaping, Home Repair, IT Service).StepAI Action/QuestionUser Input/Data GatheredAI Guardrails/Notes1.1 Welcome & Context"Hello! I'm here to help you draft a professional Scope of Work (SOW) for your project. To start, what is the main goal you want to achieve?"Project Title/Goal (e.g., "Install a new patio," "Fix my leaky roof," "Redesign my website")Establish AI's role: SOW Draftsman.1.2 Project Type"Is this a one-time Installation/Build, a Repair/Fix, or an Ongoing Maintenance/Service project?"Project Category (e.g., Installation)Narrows down the subsequent specialized questions.1.3 Timeline"Do you have a target completion date or a general timeframe (e.g., 'ASAP,' 'Within 3 months')?"Target Timeline (e.g., July 1st)Essential constraint for vendor bidding.1.4 Location/Site"What is the location where the work will be performed? (e.g., 'Backyard,' 'Master Bathroom,' 'Server Room')"Site Location (e.g., Backyard)Contextualizes physical constraints later on.Phase 2: Defining the Core Deliverables (The "What")This is the most critical phase where the AI uses the Project Category from Phase 1.2 to ask specific, technical follow-up questions.StepAI Action/QuestionUser Input/Data GatheredAI Guardrails/Notes2.1 Specialized Inquiry"Let's focus on the new patio. Please describe the deliverables—the physical results you expect. What are the key components?"Deliverable List (e.g., Patio, Walkway, Lighting, Grading)Encourage bullet points/list format.2.2 Scope Detail 1 (Material)"For the patio, what material are you planning to use? (e.g., Pavers, Stamped Concrete, Wood Decking)"Material Specification (e.g., Interlocking concrete pavers, dark grey)Forces non-expert to choose specific, vendor-friendly terms.2.3 Scope Detail 2 (Size/Specs)"What are the approximate dimensions or square footage? (e.g., $15' \times 20'$ or $300 \text{ sq ft}$)"Dimensions/Scale (e.g., $300 \text{ sq ft}$)Crucial for accurate estimating. Use unit conversions if necessary.2.4 Exclusions & Client Responsibilities"To prevent miscommunication, are there any tasks you will handle yourself, or things you specifically don't want the vendor to do? (e.g., 'I will remove the old deck,' 'No plantings required')"Exclusions/Client ResponsibilitiesVital for avoiding scope creep (e.g., "Hauling debris is excluded").Phase 3: Constraints, Risks, and Success MetricsThe goal here is to document potential difficulties and establish objective ways to measure success, which is essential for the final contract.StepAI Action/QuestionUser Input/Data GatheredAI Guardrails/Notes3.1 Site/Access Constraints"Are there any site challenges a vendor should know about? (e.g., Steep slope, limited access, underground utilities, HOA restrictions)"Physical Constraints (e.g., Limited side-gate access, poor existing drainage)Prevents surprise costs for the vendor and ensures accurate bids.3.2 Required Resources"Does the vendor need access to any specific resources? (e.g., Dedicated parking spot, access to an outdoor water spigot, a key to the gate)"Resource RequirementsClear operational support for the vendor.3.3 Defining Success"How will you know the job is done well? What are the metrics? (e.g., 'The pavers must be level with no visible gaps,' 'The lights must operate on a dusk-to-dawn timer')"Acceptance Criteria (QC)Translates subjective happiness into objective quality control (QC) points.3.4 Budget/Vendor Selection"Do you have a target budget range for this project?"Budget RangeIf not provided, the AI should use its knowledge base to provide a realistic range based on the scope.Phase 4: SOW Generation and ReviewThe AI compiles all the gathered information into a professional, structured SOW document.StepAI Action/QuestionAI Output/FormatAI Guardrails/Notes4.1 Compilation(AI silently compiles all data from Phases 1-3.)Draft SOW Document (Using the structured JSON or Markdown Table format from the seed template)The output must be formatted for copy-paste clarity.4.2 Review & Finalization"I have compiled the Scope of Work. Please review the structured document below for accuracy. Are there any items you need to clarify, add, or remove before it is vendor-ready?"Confirmation/EditsCrucial step for customer sign-off on the scope. Emphasize that this is the final, objective document.4.3 Vendor Delivery"The SOW is now finalized. I recommend attaching this document directly to your Request for Quote (RFQ) to ensure all bids are apples-to-apples."Final SOW DocumentProvide an encouraging, clear next step for the homeowner.This flow ensures the AI acts as a smart interviewer, pulling out the necessary technical details from the non-expert user, resulting in a document that protects both the homeowner (clear expectations) and the vendor (clear constraints and exclusions).
