Update the TUDAO Dashboard project to use the following unified login and homepage flow.
This flow must be implemented exactly as written:

1. HOMEPAGE (for all visitors)

The homepage (/) must include:

A. Public Landing Section

TUDAO logo

Headline + tagline

Short explanation of TUDAO

Three simple cards:

“Hire a Provider”

“Become a Provider”

“Buy a Node”

These cards do NOT assign a role — they only scroll or link to informational text.

B. Login Buttons (normal Web2-style)

Display two buttons:

Log In

Create Account

Both buttons must trigger the Privy Connect flow (embedded wallet allowed).

The homepage must NOT mention Architect, Developer, or Admin.

2. AFTER LOGIN — DETERMINE WHETHER USER IS NEW OR RETURNING

When the user completes login:

A. If wallet address is MY architect wallet

(my wallet address is: PUT YOUR ADDRESS HERE)

→ Auto-assign role = “architect”
→ Redirect immediately to /dashboard/architect
→ Do NOT show role selection
→ Do NOT show onboarding

This must work silently in the background.

B. If user exists in database AND already has a role

→ Automatically redirect them to their correct dashboard

Routing rules:

provider → /dashboard/provider

consumer → /dashboard/consumer

nodeholder → /dashboard/nodeholder

architect → /dashboard/architect

C. If user is NEW (no role set yet)

→ Redirect to /onboarding/path
This page shows:

Hire a Provider

Become a Provider

I Own a Node

Selecting one sets their role in the database and routes them to the correct dashboard.

3. REMOVE CLUTTER FROM PUBLIC VIEW
The following MUST NOT appear on the homepage:

Architect Login

Developer Login

Role Switcher

Nodeholder workspace

Provider workspace

Any internal dashboards

Any debug UI

The homepage should look like a normal SaaS product.

4. CLEAN SIDEBAR / DASHBOARD ACCESS

The sidebar must only appear AFTER login.
Do NOT show sidebar on:

Home page

Onboarding Path

Login

Create Account

5. SUMMARY OF THE REQUIRED LOGIC
WHEN USER ARRIVES AT “/”:

Show landing page + login buttons.

AFTER LOGIN:

If architect wallet → Architect Dashboard

If returning user → Their role dashboard

If new user → Role Selection page

This must happen automatically without user interaction.

6. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Store user roles in Supabase or local mock DB (for now)

Add a helper function getUserRole(walletAddress)

Use middleware or server components to handle routing

The homepage must not require authentication

Deliverables

Updated homepage

Removed Architect Login from public pages

Working new/returning user auto-router

Role selection page only for first-time users

Dashboard accessible ONLY after login
