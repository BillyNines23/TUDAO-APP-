You are building the TUDAO Master Dashboard.
Create a complete Next.js application using App Router with the following structure:

1. GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS
Branding

Use TUDAO blue/steel color scheme.

Include TU logo placeholder in the top-left sidebar header.

Global tagline: “For Those Who Do the Work.”

Layout

Create a global app shell with:

Left sidebar (role-based navigation)

Top header (wallet connect button, notifications)

Main content area

Responsive + clean professional styling (shadcn/ui + Tailwind)

2. WALLET INTEGRATION (Required Immediately)

Install and configure Privy authentication + embedded wallet:

@privy-io/react-auth
@privy-io/server-auth


Add:

“Connect Wallet” button in top-right

Automatically create embedded Base wallet on login

After login → redirect user to /dashboard

Store user roles in local state for now:

provider

consumer

nodeholder

architect

3. ROUTING STRUCTURE

Create the following folder/pages:

/app
  /home
  /dashboard
      /provider
      /consumer
      /nodeholder
      /architect
  /wallet
  /onboarding
      /provider
  /scope
  /nodes
      /buy


Add placeholder content in each page:

Title

Description

Breadcrumb

Sample UI box

4. GLOBAL SIDEBAR (ROLE-BASED)

Sidebar should show:

For ALL users

Home

Wallet

Scope Agent

Buy Nodes

Settings

Provider

My Jobs

Earnings

Escrow

Ratings

Consumer

Request Service

My Projects

Payments

Nodeholder

My Nodes

Rewards Vault

Governance

Architect (Admin)

Emissions Dashboard

Node Analytics

Verification Queue

Whale Oversight

System Settings

Use conditional rendering based on local role.

5. PAGES TO POPULATE LATER

Add empty stub components:

/dashboard/provider

/dashboard/consumer

/dashboard/nodeholder

/dashboard/architect

/scope (AI scope wizard will be plugged here)

/onboarding/provider

/nodes/buy

For now, they should say:

“This module will integrate an existing TUDAO component.”

6. USE SHADCN/UI FOR COMPONENTS

Install:

shadcn-ui
tailwindcss
lucide-react
clsx


Use shadcn for:

Sidebar

Cards

Buttons

Inputs

Page headers

Navigation menu

7. FINAL DELIVERABLES

Generate:

✔ Full Next.js project
✔ Global layout shell (sidebar + header)
✔ Privy wallet integration
✔ Role-based navigation
✔ Clean placeholder dashboard for each role
✔ Modular pages ready for silo integration
✔ /home landing page with TUDAO branding

This project will serve as the unified TUDAO platform where all existing silos (Provider Onboarding, Scope Agent, Node Sales, Emissions Dashboard) will be plugged in."
